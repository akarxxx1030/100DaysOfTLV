## Introduction to Sequential Logic in Transaction Level Verilog
---
Hey there! You've made it past Day 2! Safe to say that basic logic building takes a notch higher in this day as we look to combat sequential examples adding to the fundamentals covered so far. 🍾

#### Short Recap ⏪
> Combinatorial Logic Designs encompassing half-adder, full-adder, half-subtractor, and hierarchical multiplexer logic!
Feel free to visit [Day2.md](https://github.com/akarxxx1030/100DaysOfTLV/blob/main/Day2/Day2.md) to pick up and let's get started.

Flip-Flops are Digital Circuits that follow Sequential Logic when accomplishing tasks dealing with storing and transferring data in the form of bits. This exercise looks at instantiating and implementing a simple D Flip-Flop in Transaction-Level Verilog!
